# Dotfiles

> These are my personal dotfiles -  files that shape and customize my development environment.  I tinker with these configurations almost weekly. Due to this constant iteration and experimentation, consider these files a living document rather than a stable release.


## Installation

Clone the dotfiles repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aresshu/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

manager.sh is a script used to create symlinks.

```bash
./manager.sh

Usage: manager.sh [options]
   link             Create symbolic links
```
